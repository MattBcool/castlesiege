## A Minecraft 1.9.4 plugin made for the Tales of War server

### Features:
* Teams with colored nametags
* Class system
* Animated flags and capturing animations
* Game map with spawning features
* Game management system
* Saved stats
* Custom ranks

This plugin is an outdated build of the final version which was put together by myself and serves as a benchmark for future capture the flag gamemodes. 

The most up-to-date version is no longer recoverable and has sadly been lost. It featured guilds, several moving map components, and over 10 more siege weapons and flag types.
